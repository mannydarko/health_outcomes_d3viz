# Data Journalism and D3

This project was a data parsing and vizualization project. In it we were to find the correlation of two major health outcomes. In this instance we looked at effect of age and income on health risks by state (obesity, healthcare access and smoking). The project involved data cleaning and formatting in Excel. Before vizualizing a rend needed to be found using the Correlation function in Excel. Vizualization of the correlations was done using Java and D3.

The data used was 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. It contains data on all States within United States and Puerto Rico.
